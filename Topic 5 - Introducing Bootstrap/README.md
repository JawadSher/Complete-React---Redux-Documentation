# Bootstrap Integration

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites and web applications.

Bootstrap provides developers with a collection of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, as well as a responsive grid system, which helps in quickly creating consistent and visually appealing layouts.
