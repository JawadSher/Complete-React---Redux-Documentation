# React Components

React applications are built using components, which are reusable and encapsulated pieces of UI.Components can be nested within each other to create complex UI structures.

In React, components are the building blocks used to create user interfaces. A component encapsulates a piece of UI, which can include HTML elements, other components, styles, and functionality. React components can be thought of as custom HTML elements with their own behavior and rendering logic.

React components can be nested within each other to create complex UI structures. They promote reusability and modularity, as components can be composed and reused across different parts of an application.

React applications are structured as a tree of components, with the App component serving as the root that brings everything together.
