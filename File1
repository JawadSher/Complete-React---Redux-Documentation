
# React: A Brief Introduction

**React** is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where UI changes dynamically based on user interactions.

Developed by Facebook in 2011, **React** allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of those components.

## Working of DOM

- Browser takes HTML & creates DOM. JS helps us to modify DOM based on user actions or events.
- In some cases, managing big applications by using JS to manipulate DOM becomes complicated.

## Problems with JavaScript

- **React** has a simpler mental model.
- JS is unmanageable.
- JS is error-prone.
- JS is hard to maintain.

## Working of React

- **React** creates a Virtual DOM in memory.
- Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, **React** creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
- **React** only changes what needs to be changed!
- **React** finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
- No need to worry about querying & updating DOM elements.
- **React** creates a web page with small & reusable components.
- **React** will take care of creating & updating DOM elements.
- It saves a lot of time because all components are already available.

## JS vs React

- JS is imperative - you define steps to reach your desired state.
- **React** is declarative - you define the target UI state & then react figures out how to reach that state.
